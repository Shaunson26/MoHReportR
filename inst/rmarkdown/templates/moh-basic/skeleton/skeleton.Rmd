## Preamble

This document lays the groundwork for a template MoH HTML report. This is still
a document under development. The YAML controls some other settings than commonly
encountered with default Rmarkdown documents.  

## YAML

### output

This uses the `MoHReportR::html_document_moh()` function to incorporate thematic
files to style the HTML

```
output: MoHReportR::html_document_moh
```

### logo and co-brand

There is a NSW Government logo at the top right of the document with an optional
co-brand title. Remove `co-brand` line if not required.

```
co-brand: "Co-brand title"
```

### document_width

This controls the width of the document body. An valid values to the CSS width
parameter work here; '100px', '100%', '100vw'. Default is `800px;`. The CSS style
`margin:auto;` is always included to center the document body.

## Regular R code

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
