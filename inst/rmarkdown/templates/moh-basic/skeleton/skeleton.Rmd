```

## Preamble

This document lays the groundwork for a template MoH HTML report. This is still
a document under development. The YAML controls some other settings than commonly
encountered with default Rmarkdown documents.  

## YAML

### output

This uses the `MoHReportR::html_document_moh()` function to incorporate thematic
files to style the HTML

```
output: MoHReportR::html_document_moh

```

### logo

A logo will be placed in the top right of the document next to the title (in a
flexbox). A root option `logo` with 2 options exist; `image` is the image file and
`height` is the display height in px.

```
logo: 
  image: 'path_to_logo.png'
  height: 60
```

### document_width

This controls the width of the document body. An valid values to the CSS width
parameter work here; '100px', '100%', '100vw'. Default is `800px;`. The CSS style
`margin:auto;` is always included to center the document body.

## Regular R code

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
